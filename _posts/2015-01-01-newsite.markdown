New year, New website.
<Br />
<Br />

I have switched over from a hacky static generated website that I rolled one night over to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

This is hosted by [github's pages](https://pages.github.com), and you can see how it all works in [my git repo](https://github.com/daniellawrence/daniellawrence.github.io/) for this site.
